Apache Kafka (For Events; Download "kafka-console-consumer.sh" script to run in local) , Apache Pinot (Columnar database For Metrics and real-time data ingestion (not micro-batching), Upsert Stream, Tumbling Window, Hopping Window, Watermark), Amazon Kinesis , Apache Zookeeper () , Apache Flink, Hadoop , Apache Spark (Non Streaming Platform), Apache Helix, Apache Storm , Apache Samza, Pyflink (Stream processing for Non-JVM World), PyIceberg, Algorithm for Java JVM Tuning (i.e. Serial, Parallel , G1, GC, CMS, etc.)  <br />
| Tools / Library | Short Desc | Layman description | 
| :---: | :---: | :---: | 
| Apache Kafka  | Producer and Consumer [Alternative tool RabbitMQ for real time processing] | An event has “what” and “when” questions? | 
| Apache PIG | | To process large Datasets via Javascript either from Hadoop (Scala), Kafka | 
| Apache Pinot | OLAP Datastore (Alternative to Data Lake/Data Warehouse for creating metrics) | Pinot data segments, for data process (either from SparkQL / kafka) |
| Amazon Kinesis | ETL tool service provided by AWS ( Deigned for Data Streams) | Mainly used for adding watermarks for data latency error factor, etc |
| Apache Zookeeper | Centralized server that provide discovery and control the distributed server systems (Especially use in Kafka)  | Controller for Kafka topics (Jobs), he will transfer relevant information to relevant topics (jobs) over a distributed system. |
| Apache Flink | Stream processing and batch processing Java framework use for faster results for data processing | We can use its library under spring boot framework. It’s used for Real time processing. |
| Apache Spark | Data Filter for Hadoop | SparkQL will used for data extraction form Hadoop, PySpark Library, Py4J Library | 
| Apache Helix | Use to defined partitions for cluster of systems | sharding data (defined multiple data storage system over the same volume for distributed storing and retrieval). You can use  Apache helix over Hadoop for sharding. |
| Apache Storm | Compute System for distributed stream processing  | As OS/VM machine compute bytes for our Java code, similarly for computing distributed system apache storm will use in cloud. Storm will decide how machine power will be utilize to process request. |
| Apache Samza | Real time analytical Pipeline | Similarly like Microsoft Power BI Tool. |
| Apache Mesos | Alternative of Kubernetes | |
| Apache DataSketches | Java Library| |

**NOTE**: Elastic Open-Telemetry: Using open telemetry you can create your log data into standard format JSON structure for sharing to different APMs like elastic APM, etc. Vagrant, Chef, Ansible used for creating configuration scripts. Executing Cypress testcases with bamboo using docker images.
